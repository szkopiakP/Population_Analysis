## Population_Analysis

Hello! I'm **Piotrek Szkopiak** and this is my training project to improve my skills for data science, specially - _data analyse_.

### Overview

In this project I focused on _cleaning and modifying data_ from [Polish Central Statistical Office](https://stat.gov.pl) what contains information about Polish population. My goal was to search answers for 3 questions about this particular data:

> - [x] Population value by age and gender in 2021

>> [Population Tab](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Population_Analysis/blob/main/Population_1.png)

>> [Population Fig 1](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Population_Analysis/blob/main/Population_2.png)

>> [Population Fig 2](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Population_Analysis/blob/main/Population_3.png)

> - [x] Density by region in 2021

>> [Density Tab](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Population_Analysis/blob/main/Density_1.png)

>> [Density Fig](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Population_Analysis/blob/main/Density_2.png)

> - [x] Dependency ratio in 2021

>> [Dependency Tab](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Population_Analysis/blob/main/Dependency_1.png)

>> [Dependency Tab](https://github.com/szkopiakP/Population_Analysis/blob/main/Dependency_1.png)
   
I used `Jupyter Notebook` for easy notes, comments and real time working with code. Programming language is Python - `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`. Data from Office are in `.csv` format.
